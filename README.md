#lessless
Compiles all your project's LESS into CSS, converts LESS <links> into regular CSS <links>, and removes less.js from your html page.

WARNING: This tool modifies your source code and therefore is meant to be run as part of a build process that creates a copy of your project files(like RequireJS and others)
